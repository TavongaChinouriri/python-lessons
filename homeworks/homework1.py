# CHALLENGE: Average Mark Calculator
# Goal: Use variables, data types, and arithmetic operations to calculate
# a student's total and average mark based on four subjects.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- TASK 1: Variable Declaration and Initialization ---

# 1. Declare two string variables for the student's name and surname.
name = " " # Replace the space with your own first name
last_name = " " # Replace the space with your own last name

# 2. Declare four integer variables (mark1, mark2, mark3, mark4)
# and assign them any score out of 100.
mark1 = 85
mark2 = 92
mark3 = 78
mark4 = 95


# --- TASK 2: Calculation ---

# 3. Calculate the sum of all four marks and store the result in a variable named 'total'.
total = # YOUR CODE HERE

# 4. Calculate the average mark by dividing the 'total' by the number of subjects (4).
# Store the result in a variable named 'average'.
average = # YOUR CODE HERE


# --- TASK 3: Output ---

# 5. Use the print() function to display the student's full name, the total mark,
# and the final average mark in a clear, readable format.

# Example Output Format:
# Student: [Name] [Last_Name]
# Total Score: [Total] / 400
# Average Mark: [Average] %
